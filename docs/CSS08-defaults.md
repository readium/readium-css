# Defaults

[Implementers’ doc] [Authors’ info]

Defaults is currently made of 5 stylesheets:

- 1 base stylesheet for all ebooks;
- 1 default reading mode stylesheet for all ebooks (day mode);
- 1 default stylesheet for unstyled ebooks;
- 1 stylesheet to deal with the OS’ a11y modes.

**Note:** The default stylesheet should not be appended if there are author styles in the EPUB file.

## Base

The base stylesheet deals with: 

1. default typography;
2. default font-family depending on the language.

Those values are obviously customizable.

It should be appended before any author’s stylesheet.

### Variables you can set

#### Default font-stacks

#### Default font-stacks for Japanese publications

We’ve been trying to follow the recommendations of the [EBPAJ File Creation Guide](http://ebpaj.jp/counsel/guide) and provide specific font-stacks that can handle both horizontal and vertical writing.

Those font-stacks have been modeled after fonts the templates of this guide use as defaults, and extend support to the largest amount of platforms possible. 

* * *

```
--RS__serif-ja
```

A Mincho font-stack whose fonts with proportional latin characters are prioritized for horizontal writing.

Fonts are not necessarily pre-installed, which is the reason why this font-stack is extensive.

Default is `"Hiragino Mincho ProN", "Hiragino Mincho Pro", "YuMincho", "BIZ UDPMincho", "Yu Mincho", "ＭＳ Ｐ明朝", "MS PMincho", serif`.

* * *

```
--RS__sans-serif-ja
```

A Gothic font-stack whose fonts with proportional latin characters are prioritized for horizontal writing.

Fonts are not necessarily pre-installed, which is the reason why this font-stack is extensive.

Default is `"Hiragino Sans", "Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN", "Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro", "ヒラギノ角ゴ W3", "YuGothic", "Yu Gothic Medium", "BIZ UDPGothic", "Yu Gothic", "ＭＳ Ｐゴシック", "MS PGothic", sans-serif`.

* * *

```
--RS__serif-ja-v
```

A Mincho font-stack whose fonts with fixed-width latin characters are prioritized for vertical writing.

Fonts are not necessarily pre-installed, which is the reason why this font-stack is extensive.

Default is `"Hiragino Mincho ProN", "Hiragino Mincho Pro", "YuMincho", "BIZ UDMincho", "Yu Mincho", "ＭＳ明朝", "MS Mincho", serif`.

* * *

```
--RS__sans-serif-ja-v
```

A Gothic font-stack whose fonts with fixed-width latin characters are prioritized for vertical writing.

Fonts are not necessarily pre-installed, which is the reason why this font-stack is extensive.

Default is `"Hiragino Sans", "Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN", "Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro", "ヒラギノ角ゴ W3", "YuGothic", "Yu Gothic Medium", "BIZ UDGothic", "Yu Gothic", "ＭＳゴシック", "MS Gothic", sans-serif`.

#### Absolute defaults for all ebooks

* * *

```
--RS__baseFontFamily
```

The default typeface for body copy in case the ebook doesn’t have one declared.

Please note some languages have a specific font-stack (japanese, chinese, hindi, etc.)

* * *

```
--RS__baseLineHeight
```

The default line-height for body copy in case the ebook doesn’t have one declared.

We’re using an algorithm to find the ideal `line-height` for the current font based on its metrics (see details in the next subsection below).

* * *

```
--RS__lineHeightCompensation
```

The compensation factor (integer) the dynamic leading pseudo-algorithm must apply, if used. Default is `1` i.e. no compensation.

This variable is redefined by default, in languages and scripts which need compensation due to the characteristics of their average fonts’ metrics.

### Dynamic leading (line-height)

If we don’t provide a base `line-height` and the author hasn’t explicitely set one, then the `normal` value will be applied. On average, it is less than `1.2`, which makes leading quite solid and can quickly become a readability issue with some fonts, especially the ones with a large x-height.

Readium CSS consequently uses an algorithm to find the ideal leading for each font by default (with a fallback value accomodating every script/language it supports).

This algorithm tries to:

1. automagically adjust the `line-height` to the current typeface;
2. adjust this ideal `line-height` it has just computed to the current `font-size` the user has set.

```
calc((1em + (2ex - 1ch) - ((1rem - 16px) * 0.1667)) * var(--RS__lineHeightCompensation))
```

In which, `--RS__lineHeightCompensation` is a factor whose default is `1`. Indeed, the `line-height` is usually 15–20% larger in CJK than in other scripts/languages (factor of `1.167`), but it can also used for square-ish fonts, especially in Indic.

The results we could get for the vast majority of fonts can be described as good in terms of typographic color. Here is Iowan Old Style for instance.

![Comparison of the algorithm using four different font-sizes with the Iowan Old Style typeface. We can notice that the leading applied is solider as font-size increases, which results in a relatively even distribution of typographic color. This is confirmed by the computed values retrieved in the tool ReadiumCSS provides for testing.](assets/dynamic-leading.jpg)

This isn’t a perfect solution though, and this algorithm may be revisited in the future.

See [Further Details](../docs/CSS18-further_details.md) for an extensive explanation.

## Day Mode

The `ReadiumCSS-day_mode.css` stylesheet serves as a default and handles `background-color` and `color` for `:root` and `::selection`.

### Variables you can set

* * *

```
--RS__backgroundColor
```

The `background-color` for the entire viewport.

* * *

```
--RS__textColor
```

The `color` for body copy.

* * *

```
--RS__selectionBackgroundColor
```

The `background-color` for selected text.

It is worth noting it can be customized for each reading mode.

* * *

```
--RS__selectionTextColor
```

The `color` for selected text.

It is worth noting it can be customized for each reading mode.

## Default

The default stylesheet was designed for unstyled ebooks. It is based on HTML5 Suggested Rendering and can be customized. 

Although it must not be used for styled ebooks, it should not impact the author’s styles if it is added before its stylesheet(s).

You can customize: 

- the typeface for headings (body is in `base.css`);
- the typeface for code;
- the font-size for body copy;
- the base line-height for all elements;
- the vertical margins for block elements;
- the vertical margins for paragraphs;
- the text-indent for paragraphs;
- the typescale;
- the color for links (including visited);
- a primary accent color (unused by default);
- a secondary accent color (unused by default).

It makes use of a typescale so that you can change it dynamically (depending on page size, font size, etc.) so that headings and other elements can be adjusted.

### Variables you can set

#### Typefaces 

* * *

```
--RS__compFontFamily
```

The typeface for headings. The value can be another variable e.g. `var(-RS__humanistTf)`.

* * *

```
--RS__codeFontFamily
```

The typeface for code snippets. The value can be another variable e.g. `var(-RS__monospaceTf)`.

#### Typography

* * *

```
--RS__typeScale
```

The scale to be used for computing all elements’ `font-size`. Since those font sizes are computed dynamically, you can set a smaller type scale when the user sets one of the largest font sizes.

Possible values: `1` | `1.067` | `1.125` | `1.2` (suggested default) | `1.25` | `1.333` | `1.414` | `1.5` | `1.618`

* * *

```
--RS__baseFontSize
```

The default `font-size` for body copy. It will serve as a reference font all related computations.

* * *

```
--RS__baseLineHeight
```

The default `line-height` for all elements.

#### Vertical rhythm

* * *

```
--RS__flowSpacing
```

The default vertical margins for HTML5 flow content e.g. `pre`, `figure`, `blockquote`, etc.

* * *

```
--RS__paraSpacing
```

The default vertical margins for paragraphs.

* * *

```
--RS__paraIndent
```

The default `text-indent` for paragraphs.

#### Hyperlinks

* * *

``` 
--RS__linkColor
```

The default `color` for hyperlinks.

* * *

```
--RS__visitedColor
```

The default `color` for visited hyperlinks.

#### Accentuation colors

* * *

```
--RS__primaryColor
```

An optional primary accentuation `color` you could use for headings or any other element of your choice.

* * *

```
--RS__secondaryColor
```

An optional secondary accentuation `color` you could use for any element of your choice.

## OS’ a11y modes

This stylesheet is intended to deal with a11y settings users can set at the OS level, whenever possible: 

- high-contrast mode;
- inverted colors;
- monochrome;
- reduced motion.

For `monochrome`, we’ll have to adjust reading modes (night, sepia, etc.) in their specific stylesheet; we’ll see if we can at least manage some more global settings in there.
